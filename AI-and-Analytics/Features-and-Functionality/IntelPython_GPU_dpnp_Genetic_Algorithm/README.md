# `Genetic Algorithms on GPU using Intel® Distribution for Python* dpnp` Sample

The `Genetic Algorithms on GPU using Intel® Distribution for Python* dpnp` sample shows how to implement a general genetic algorithm (GA) and offload computation to a GPU using dpnp.

| Property                    | Description
| :---                    | :---
| Category                | Code Optimization
| What you will learn     | How to implement the genetic algorithm using the Data-parallel Extension for NumPy* (dpnp)?
| Time to complete        | 8 minutes

>**Note**: This sample is validated on Intel® Distribution for Python* Offline Installer and AI Tools Offline Installer. For the full list of validated platforms refer to [Platform Validation](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#platform-validation).

## Purpose

In this sample, you will create and run the general genetic algorithm and optimize it to run on GPU using the Intel® Distribution for Python* dpnp. You will learn what are selection, crossover, and mutation, and how to adjust those methods from general genetic algorithm to a specific optimization problem which is the Traveling Salesman Problem.

## Prerequisites

| Optimized for           | Description
|:---                     |:---
| OS                      | Ubuntu* 20.04
| Hardware                | GPU
| Software                | Intel® Distribution for Python*

## Key Implementation Details

This sample code is implemented for GPUs using Python. The sample assumes you have dpnp installed inside a Conda environment, similar to what is installed with the Intel® Distribution for Python*.

The sample tutorial contains one Jupyter Notebook and one Python script. You can use either.

## Environment Setup
You will need to download and install the following toolkits to use the sample.
<!-- Use numbered steps instead of subheadings -->

**1. Get Intel® Distribution for Python***

If you have not already, install Intel® Distribution for Python* via [Installer](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/distribution-python-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&linux-install-type=offline).

**2. Activate the Intel® Distribution for Python\* base environment**
<!-- this step is from AI Tools GSG, please don't modify unless GSG is updated -->
If the default path is used during the installation of Intel® Distribution for Python*:
```
source $HOME/intelpython3/bin/activate
```
If a non-default path is used:
```
source <custom_path>/bin/activate
```

**3. Clone the GitHub repository**
<!-- for oneapi-samples: git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git
cd oneAPI-samples/AI-and-Analytics/<samples-folder>/<individual-sample-folder> -->
<!-- for migrated samples - provide git clone command for individual repo and cd to sample dir --> 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git
cd oneAPI-samples/AI-and-Analytics/Features-and-Functionality/IntelPython_GPU_dpnp_Genetic_Algorithm
```

**4. Install dependencies**
<!-- It is required to have requirement.txt file in sample dir. It should list additional libraries, such as matplotlib, ipykernel etc. -->
>**Note**: Before running the following commands, make sure your Conda environment is activated

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install notebook
``` 
For Jupyter Notebook, refer to [Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) for detailed installation instructions.

## Run the Sample
>**Note**: Before running the sample, make sure [Environment Setup](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/AI-and-Analytics/Features-and-Functionality/IntelPython_GPU_dpnp_Genetic_Algorithm#environment-setup) is completed.

### Intel® Distribution for Python* Offline Installer (Validated)

**1. Register Conda kernel to Jupyter Notebook kernel**

If the default path is used during the installation of Intel® Distribution for Python*:
```
$HOME/intelpython3/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name=base
```
If a non-default path is used:
```
<custom_path>/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name=base
```
**2. Launch Jupyter Notebook** 
<!-- add other flags to jupyter notebook command if needed, such as port 8888 or allow-root -->
```
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0
```
**3. Follow the instructions to open the URL with the token in your browser**

**4. Select the Notebook**
<!-- add sample file name -->
```
IntelPython_GPU_dpnp_Genetic_Algorithm.ipynb
```
**5. Change the kernel to `base`**
  <!-- specify relevant kernel name(s), for example `pytorch` -->
**6. Run every cell in the Notebook in sequence**

## Example Output

If successful, the sample displays `[CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY]` at the end of execution. The sample will print out the runtimes and charts of relative performance with dpnp and without any optimizations as the baseline. Additionally, sample will print the best and worst path found in the Traveling Salesman Problem.
